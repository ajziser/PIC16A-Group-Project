# PIC16A Group Project: Clustering Penguins
## Anna Ziser, Lauren Nemeh, Lyndsey Mitsch

In our project, we explore the penguins dataset and manipulate the data through graphing and training the data with a decision tree model. As a group, we felt like we needed more practice working with datsets and getting more comfortable with manipulating/graphing datasets in a class. We graphed the data via scatterplots and clustering with groupby() in order to get a better understanding of the relationships between the different variables.  In our code, we referenced material from our class and discussion work.

Python packages used (and versions): pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy.

Demo description/How to run the demo file:
1. Open a new notebook and python file in JupyterLab, inside the same folder.
2. Copy CurrentCode.py into the .py file, rename the file CurrentCode, and save it. 
3. Rename the .ipynb file to DemoFile and navigate to the Demo File code from github.
4. Paste and run the first 8 lines of the Demo File into a cell in the .ipynb file to import pandas, read the penguins data, and import the CurrentCode file. There should be no errors or results from running this cell. 
5. Run line 7 inside the same cell to get a preview of the existing penguins data.  You should see the dataframe like this:

6. Create a new cell and run lines 11-13 of the Demo File to create a Project class object with the penguins dataframe, and run the clean_data function. Line 12 will show the preview of the cleaned up data, which has fewer columns compared to the original data we saw in the previous step:

There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

In the future, the scope of this project could be larger and use more models. For example, this project could be expanded through writing various algorithms such as a neural network model and comparing the models to each other to see what is the most efficient. Our project does not have any ethical implications because the datset was found online and does not have any kind of algorithmic bias.
