# PIC16A Group Project: Clustering Penguins
Anna Ziser, Lauren Nemeh, Lyndsey Mitsch

In our project, we explore the penguins dataset and manipulate the data through graphing and training the data with a decision tree model. As a group, we felt like we needed more practice working with datsets and getting more comfortable with manipulating/graphing datasets in a class. We graphed the data via scatterplots and clustering with groupby() in order to get a better understanding of the relationships between the different variables.  In our code, we referenced material from our class and discussion work.

Python packages used (and versions): pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy.

Description of the demo file: detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

In the future, the scope of this project could be larger and use more models. For example, this project could be expanded through writing various algorithms such as a neural network model and comparing the models to each other to see what is the most efficient. Our project does not have any ethical implications because the datset was found online and does not have any kind of algorithmic bias.
