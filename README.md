# PIC16A Group Project: Clustering Penguins
Anna Ziser, Lauren Nemeh, Lyndsey Mitsch

In our project, we explore the penguins dataset and manipulate the data through graphing and training the data with a decision tree model. As a group, we felt like we needed more practice working with datsets and getting more comfortable with manipulating/graphing datasets in a class. We graphed the data via scatterplots and clustering in order to get a better understanding of the relationships between the different variables

Python packages used (and versions):

Detailed description of the demo file. This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

Scope and limitations, including ethical implications, accessibility concerns, and ideas for potential extensions.
